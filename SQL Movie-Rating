Below are some of my answers to questions from the edX course Databases: Relational Databases and SQL

My queries were executed using SQLite.


For each movie, return the title and the 'rating spread', that is, the difference between highest and lowest ratings 
given to that movie. Sort by rating spread from highest to lowest, then by movie title.

select title, (max(stars) - min(stars)) as Rating_Spread
from Movie 
inner join Rating using (mId)
group by mID
order by Rating_Spread desc, title;



ind the difference between the average rating of movies released before 1980 and the average rating of movies released after 1980. 
(Make sure to calculate the average rating for each movie, then the average of those averages for movies before 1980 and movies after. 
Don't just calculate the overall average rating before and after 1980.)

select avg (before1980.avg) - avg(after1980.avg)
from (
	select avg (stars) as avg 
	from Movie 
	inner join Rating using (mId)
	where Movie.year < 1980
	group by mID
	)as before1980,(
	select avg (stars) as avg 
	from Movie 
	inner join Rating using (mId)
	where Movie.year > 1980
	group by mID
	)as after1980;


For each movie that has at least one rating, find the highest number of stars that movie received. Return the movie title and number 
of stars. Sort by movie title.

select title, max(stars)
from Movie 
inner join Rating using (mID)
group by mID
order by title;
